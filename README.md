# Welcome People!

This is the static linktree like site for FEN or Free Expression Now, and effort to protect and expand free expression in the USA starting at the UW. We do this in light of a culture of censorship appearing over the past decade on the left and the right and a renewed 'satanic' panic targeting LGBT people and their expression. Like the many times in the past powerful and conservative authoritarians are attacking your rights, we want to protect and expand the most fundamental of them, Freedom of Speech.

# Development

Info for people working on this website, this is **the important stuff.**

- Make sure to use **tabs** and **not** spaces!
- When writing a _component_ use the `export default function` sytax!
- Use a `ComponentProps` props interface and pass props into your components.
- Name components with the same name as the file, but not required for pages.
- Import styles with the `@/styles/css_file` path
- Import components with the `../components/component_file` path
- Place things in the right folders.

## Running the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. This will live update as you edit on each save.

<!-- You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. -->

## Dependencies and Tools Used

We are now planning on deploying this using [GitHub Pages](#todo) as a **static page!**

### `Next.js`

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

### `React-Bootstrap`

React bootstrap gives us a bunch of easy to use components such as `<Card/>`'s you can look at the components [here](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/).

> Update, we will probably not be using this package, pending removal.

<!-- ## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
